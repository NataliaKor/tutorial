# Tutorial for Deep Learning Parameter Estimation 
This tutorial is dedicted to the parameter estimation of the singla Galactic Binary. 
It starts with the simple fit of the Gaussian distribution to the posterior. Afterwards it is demonstrated how the parameter estimation can be performed with the Normalising flows.
